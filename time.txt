 
David Silver did'nt had the coding part its just plain theory ( which is of less concern to us right now ) 
Below links have theory as well python code so it might help a bit better
for today (25 may ) :-
  read about this article i think its good
  https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0
  (for implementation)
  http://www.wildml.com/2016/10/learning-reinforcement-learning/
  (for theory)
  Its very long and detailed ( i think :) )
  It even has the code with it and we'll read about everything that we would encounter but please make an effort to completely     understand the code and all underlying concepts.
  PS : we have to make pong game first
